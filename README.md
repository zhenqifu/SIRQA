Stereoscopic Image Retargeting Quality Assessment
=====================

Matlab implementation of **GDIL** stereoscopic image retargeting quality assessment measurement. IEEE TMM, 2020.

The code has been tested on the Windows 10 64-bit OS. You can run [**main_GDIL.m**](main_GDIL.m) to obtain the results. 

To verify our experimental results, you need to prepare the [NBU-SIRQA database](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uBVzAY-bXYyjVjBCItwhQA) first. Then, run the code in Verify.rar.
